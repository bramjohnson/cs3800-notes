# Circuits
It's just circuits (and, or, not)

Circuit is *DAG* with following nodes:
- Input (variable)
- Output (variable)
- Gate (operation)
and no cycles

Size of circuit = $|vertices|$
All nodes only allow 2 inputs

Circuits have **fixed** input size $\{0,1\}^n$
	each $n$ needs a different circuit.
## Theorem
1. Every function can be computed by a circuit of size $O(n * 2^n)$
		For every circuit, can convert to CNF formula that we know can be computed
2. Any efficient TM can be solved efficiently on circuits
		Takes value of four positions from previous TM and sends output to next layer of TM
	Takes $O(T^2(n))$ time to construct circuit from TM.
## Alternative SAT Example
Alternative proof that SAT is NP-Complete
	$CKTSAT = \{<C>: \exists x : C(x) = 1\}$

Let $L \in NP$ with verifier $V$ having run-time $T(|w|)$
1. Reduce $L$ to $CKTSAT$ using reducer $R(w)$
2. Reduce $CKTSAT$ to $SAT$ by creating a CNF formula that represents every aspect of of the original circuit (each step is consistent).
## Large Circuits
Are there functions that require large circuits?
	Function with size less than $O(2^n$)
Yes, proof using counting. At least $2^{2^n}$ functions exist.
	We need at least $2^n/4n$ functions

# P-Poly
PPoly is the group of circuits that are poly-size
	We know every P $\subset$ PPoly
	We don't know $NP \subset PPoly$
	Harder than proving $P \neq NP$

# Undecidable PPoly
There exist undecidable $TM$ languages that can be solved by $PPoly$
	Every unary language $L$ with only strings of 1s is in PPoly
	PPoly can decide the undecidable language $ATM$ with only 1s using a giant and gate.

PPoly can solve P, some of NP, not a lot of EXP, and very little decidable languages (can solve some undecidable).
