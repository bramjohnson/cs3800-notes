# Overview
## Key Questions
- What is "computation"?
- What is an "algorithm"?
- What *can* or *cannot* be computed?
- Can we assign a mathematical definition?
- What are the formal models of computation?
## Computation: Definition
"Specified *procedure* consisting of *simple operations*."
	Algorithms outdate computers; human-centric notion; explainable

Use simple mathematical definitions to prove theorems about computation.
## Course Sections
### Automata Theory
Goal: Computing with no memory; simple.
**Finite Automata**: fixed finite number of states.
	What can/cannot be computed using *finite automata*?
### Computability
Goal: Precise model of general computation.
	What can/cannot be computed by *any* known computer?
**Turing Machine:** unbounded length of memory.
### Complexity
Goal: Define what can be computed *efficiently*.
	Are there problems where verifying solution is efficient, but finding solution is not?
**P=NP** problem: if we can check a solution, can we find the solution?
